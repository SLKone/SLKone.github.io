We’ve all heard the phrase, “cash is king”, representing a simple, yet widely misconstrued concept -- cultivation of cash. You would think that a business with a solid model would inevitably grow their cash base over time and ride off into the sunset, but the COVID crisis has exposed businesses around the world for having poor cash management processes. The good news is we’re here to help.

In our experience encountering cash management scenarios, the main issue identified is a fundamental misunderstanding of the term “cash management”. Some believe it to be as simple as the popularized 13-week cash flow tool, a short preview of your company’s cash performance for just over three months. Others view it as a supporting character in their company’s prolific storyline, only to address it when their plotline takes a dark twist. Whatever your viewpoint of cash management may be, it should always be at the forefront of your priority list.

In the <a href="https://slkone.com/What-Does-Cash-Management-Actually-Mean/">attached article</a>, SLKone founding partner, Phil Lynch, and I dive into what cash management actually means. We’ll walk you through the time-tested 13-week cash flow tool, cultivating the right cash-focused culture, the importance of having effective cash management processes across all departments, and evoking proper technology to support those processes. Remember, when the chips are down, you will want to be able to put your mind at ease knowing you’ve got a healthy war-chest of cash to weather you through the storm.
