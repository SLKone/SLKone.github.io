The economy is in flux. Decision makers are faced with unforeseen circumstances, and the tried and true rules of engagement are no longer guarantees. This is a time to tread carefully with deep, deliberate thought.

Deliberate Thinking is a process, and therefore can be improved. The first step of that improvement is awareness. By setting aside five minutes a day to journal a difficult decision faced and the method used to solve it, you can take stock of your personal decision-making toolbox. This awareness reveals gaps for growth and enables reapplication of these tools to future circumstances. Take a shot at doing it for a week or even a month, then come back and reflect – you may be surprised at what you learn about your own thinking style!
