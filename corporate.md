title: "SLKone's Corporate Practice"
subtitle: "Strategy + Leadership + Knowledge"
intro: "These are the three legs every corporation stands on; however, the difference between moving at a crawl versus sprinting is defined by how well you progress from operationalization to execution across these three legs."
excerpt: "Businesses often trip up operationalizing and executing strategy. This is because you assure certain outcomes to stakeholders in uncertain environments–only to find yourself scrambling to harness the organizational knowledge locked within your people and systems to meet those results for your shareholders and sponsors. SLKone bridges strategy, leadership, and knowledge to build lasting solutions for you."

		<h4>Strategy</h4>
		<p>Businesses today are operating under extreme uncertainty. Yet, business leaders are expected to commit to predictable outcomes for their stakeholders. This paradox sets expectations that cannot be supported by even the best-crafted strategies. What businesses need is the agility of a dynamic strategy that goes beyond oft-utilized chess strategy. In a game of chess, you can predict how the pieces move in and around you, within defined rules. The fluid business environment today renders a rules-based plan defunct by the time the ink dries on the corporate strategy document.</p>
		<p>We at SLKone help our clients tackle challenges such as integrations and business transformations by teaching dynamic learning skills, navigating uncharted territories and developing an ability to anticipate things around the corner.</p>

		<h4>Leadership</h4>
		<p>In the 21st-century, leadership should not be strictly defined by what is carved out at the upper tier of the organizational matrix. Instead, individuals and management teams who can orchestrate corporate resources and energy towards an outcome irrespective of their place in the pecking order represent true leadership.</p>
		<p>In the information age, leadership needs to emphasize ways to handle and manage the stress of ‘real-time’ information load, cognitive flexibility to respond to social ‘buzz’ and divergent thinking of a mixed martial arts champion to deal with what’s lurking around the corner. Managing involvement is a critical skill and leaders struggle to find the best position to make the right decisions while working with their teams.</p>

		<h4>Knowledge</h4>
		<p>Employees, performing their work through enterprise processes and connected systems, define the knowledge framework for a business. However, in a typical organization, much of the knowledge framework remains untapped because employees and processes are considered distinct from one another. As evidenced by the in vogue adoption of artificial intelligence, these digital transformations are often branded as expensive hobbies because they ignore the real intelligence that can create actual knowledge.</p>
		<p>We assist our clients in creating fountains of knowledge that result in improved internal cost efficiencies and attractive value propositions for their customers.</p>

		<h4>Operationalize</h4>
		<p>Businesses utilize slideware, change management and culture shifts as tactics to operationalize strategy. The inordinate effort spent on these tactics spanning presentations, town halls, and social media jams has little measurable ROI. Furthermore, these attempts can be nefariously detrimental as they can create deeper divides within the rank and file employees distrustful of corporate-speak.</p>
		<p>Smart leaders can prevent this confusion, save precious time and resources with behavioral changes in how the leadership walks the talk. It requires authentic responses to three fundamental questions every employee considers in their actions.</p>
		<p>These questions are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What’s in it for me?</li>
			<li>Why should I care?</li>
			<li>How can I help?</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These questions have the most significant impact on results when the answers are understood before starting any project or initiative.</p>
		<p>We at SLKone, help find the answers to these questions and do so in a way that builds credibility for the leadership – it generates a pull demand by the employees and most importantly, creates an environment of trust which speeds up execution. Operationalizing correctly also requires engineering the performance system ahead of pulling the execution trigger – further stimulating engagement and the likelihood of success.</p>

		<h4>Execution</h4>
		<p>Whether living through a significant integration, business transformation or a systems implementation, employees tending to their full-time responsibilities end up suffering from initiative overload. The solution is disciplined execution. Which requires organizing the matrix structure and activities that facilitate smooth flow of interactions in all directions by instituting accountability. It involves program management, a rigorous yet inclusive approach to steering through issues and risks. Moreover, it requires commitment. The organization must be connected, marching towards the same goal, and leadership must remain committed to the goal; break one of these legs off the stool and execution is guaranteed to fail.</p>
