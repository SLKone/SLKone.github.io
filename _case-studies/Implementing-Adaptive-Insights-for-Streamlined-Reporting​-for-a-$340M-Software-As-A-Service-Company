#### Situation
- The client was several months into a software implementation project for their FP&A function, but had failed to meet numerous deliverable deadlines causing the project to veer off course and be delayed by several weeks
- Success of this was dependent upon coordinating between several technical teams, but due to numerous other commitments and a lack of proper prioritization the client had neglected this coordination
- SLKone was engaged in order to assess and ensure that the implementation was delivered successfully and on time

#### Bespoke Solutions
- SLKone was able to bridge the gap between the FP&A department, Accounting, Sales, and the Vendor to make up for missed deadlines and billable hourly overages from the Vendor
- SLKone worked with stakeholders and developed custom datasets to feed models in the new software
- Leveraging our prior expertise, we assisted the vendor’s developers with NetSuite and Salesforce integrations
- In order to correct project mismanagement prior to our engagement, SLKone implemented a phased approach to implementation to ensure that the highest priority items were accounted for first

#### Leading With Results
- **SLKone corrected and implemented** a new FP&A reporting software which was behind in billable project hours and several weeks overdue **without any additional cost to the client**
- The client is now reporting from a single platform, which **consolidates** and **automates** all monthly **reporting, saving tens of hours each month** for the FP&A team
- Furthermore, **data integration is fully automated and secure** freeing the team to drive insight rather than files
