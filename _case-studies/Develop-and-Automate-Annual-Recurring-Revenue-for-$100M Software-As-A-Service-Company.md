#### Situation
- $100M Software-as-a-Service company focused on enterprise data management lacked financial and operational Key Performance Indicators​
- Several ‘bolt-on’ acquisitions resulted in inconsistent data quality and completeness​
    - Customer data was difficult to organize due to varying customer naming conventions and accounting policies​
- No single ‘source of truth’ existed for sales related data; customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems were poorly managed​
- Building an Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) model required intelligent consolidation of disparate data sources as well as a nuanced understanding of the pitfalls within the existing data​
- **SLKone was tasked with developing an ARR model that could be used to evaluate the performance of the business, to gain an understanding of retention metrics and upsell abilities**

#### Bespoke Solutions
- Built a fully dynamic ARR model that clearly illustrated new, churn, upsell, and downsell over various periods of time (monthly, quarterly, annually, and trailing 12 months)​
- Hosted on PowerBI to allow management real-time access to the latest information​
    - Created ancillary dashboard to support independent review by management, such as the ability to search for a customer name or review a total Product Line​
- Developed a methodology to effectively handle parent-child relationships related to customer naming​
- Developed an ‘add-on’ capability to address data clean-up needs, such as smoothing pre-payment billings, customer name changes, and more​
- Transitioned ownership to the internal Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) function after acquisition; model was further passed along the acquiring company after the client was sold​

#### Leading With Results
- SLKone **reduced update process from 3 days to 3 hours** by leveraging the intrinsic capabilities of PowerBI and Power Query​
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue dashboard was a critical piece of diligence to support the future transaction related to an unsolicited bid​**
- **Fully transitioned the update process to the internal FP&A team within a single day**
    - Developed a ‘how to’ guide as reference material for future updates; addressed ad hoc questions that may arise during future iterations​
    - **Discovered small incremental growth in recurring revenue.**  This was caused by incremental licensing upsells for a few major customers that were being offset by the churn of several mid-size customers at their renewal date.  This ran contrary to management’s running belief that they had a near 100% retention rate​
