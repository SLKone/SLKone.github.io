	<h4>SLKone supports a team-oriented culture encouraging leadership and engagement at every level.</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Goals are not executed privately at SLKone.</strong> After setting individual goals, team members share their goals with each other and commit to helping one another deliver those goals; everyone succeeds together.</li>
		<li><strong>There are multiple tracks to success.</strong> We recognize that our talent pool is comprised of innovators and builders that help sales leaders succeed, and it is reflected in our performance.</li>
		<li><strong>We value fairness and use one formula for all performance rewards.</strong> Founders, partners, managers, and consultants all earn within the same operating model.</li>
		<li><strong>Happy consultants deliver exceptional results for clients.</strong> We strive to contribute 100% of our team’s healthcare benefits, celebrate the joy of parental responsibilities through generous paid leave, and much more through programs that we encourage our team to define.</li>
		<li><strong>We give back to the community.</strong> Whether building houses or supporting education for the underprivileged, SLKone supports our team’s dedication to giving back as a core pillar to our company’s mission.</li>
