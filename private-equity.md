title: "SLKone's Private Equity Practice"
subtitle: "Stabilize > Leap > Keep-Climbing"
intro: "Every investment undergoes the sequence of Stabilize, Leap, and Keep-Climbing from acquisition to exit. However, rarely does the investment thesis and trajectory of the company map seamlessly and as the PE sponsor, you are responsible for ensuring success at each step of the sequence."
excerpt: "You fail to realize your investment thesis when your portfolio platform investment remains weak for too long. An inadequate finance function masks your operational and systemic shortcomings–causing add-on acquisitions to further destabilize your platform. All of this results in sub-par returns on EBITDA and the exacerbating consequences of long holding periods.         

SLKone works with you to stabilize your platform; ready your investments to leap forward; and build lasting solutions to keep climbing."

		<h4>The Staircase</h4>
		<p>In the PE world, the greater risk/reward profile manifests both in the motivations of the sponsors and the day to day operations of the portfolio company. As the sponsor, your margin for error is minimal and this is reflected in the expectations and incentives you set for the management team at the portfolio company. The management team facing expectations from above and wary employee base below end up walking a high-wire tightrope with tremendous crosswinds. Everything must come together perfectly to realize the investment thesis.</p>
		<p>At SLKone we take these disparate challenges among the stakeholders to Operationalize and Execute through the sequence of Stabilize, Leap and Keep-Climbing to deliver for our PE clients.</p>

		<h4>Stabilize</h4>
		<p>The investment from a new sponsor is like a jolt of lightening for the business. One would expect that renewed focus, a greater emphasis on reporting, and an expectation of urgency would help the business, however, very often it leads to anxiety and performance slippages. Stabilizing an investment; channels the energy into areas that revitalizes the businesses and prepares them to Leap forward.</p>
		<p>The window for stabilization is short, and it generally begins with pre-transaction financial and operational diligence to understand areas of weaknesses hidden behind the hockey stick charts prepared by investment bankers. It is imperative for sponsors to ‘train’ the business to their portfolio management approach. The window is short - no more than 30-60-90 days to  institute new reporting, make personnel and systems upgrades, and institute a cash discipline that makes the business healthy to leap forward.</p>

		<h4>Leap Forward</h4>
		<p>Without coordinated growth efforts, even a healthy and stabilized business can quickly dissipate its energy. Often in the urgency to meet expectations, revenue discipline is lost as management resorts to bringing in revenue at any cost whichy paralyzes the organic growth. Similarly, add-ons whether tuck-ins or sizeable acquisitions, executed without a playbook can handicap the trajectory through straddled costs. </p>
		<p>Frequently, the business finds itself adding costs that are disproportionate to creating value. Leaping forward requires building a healthy top line that is the envy of the competition while continuously factoring down the costs supported by smart systems and upgrading the management team that spends more time in informed decision making vs. fighting fires.</p>

		<h4>Keep Climbing</h4>
		<p>Even best run businesses that have leaped forward will require trimming and staying fit to keep adding multiples to EBITDA. Whether, it is customer profitability improvement, inventory optimization or harnessing shared services for an ever growing business footprint, the sponsors and management teams should be careful about capital investment timing, efficiencies,and free cash flow to perfectly time for a exit event. This in-flight maintenance effort must be managed, and leaders must keep their eye on the ball. As is often the case, the next transaction or event is just around the corner – one must constantly apply these principles to Keep Climbing.</p>
