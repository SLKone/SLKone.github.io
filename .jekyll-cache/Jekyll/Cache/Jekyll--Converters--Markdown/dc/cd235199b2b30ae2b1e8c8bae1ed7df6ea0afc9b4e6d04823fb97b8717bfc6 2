I"”<p>As we entered 2020, no one foresaw the emergence and impact of COVID-19. Business plans and expectations had to be thrown away as organizations instantly pursued a strategy of survival and value preservation. While the response to the crisis has been acute, the impact will continue indefinitely. As a result, the narrative in board rooms must quickly look to the future, and leaders must strategize how organizations can successfully emerge from this crisis.  More than during any other period, ground is gained and lost against competitors in times of crisis. Times of crises present a convenient reset point for organizations. Those that seize this opportunity to make step-change improvements to their business will emerge ready to take market share and outperform competitors.

Business transformations can take many shapes, ranging from a narrow functional focus to a holistic perspective addressing the entire business. No matter the size and scope of a transformation, all projects have some commonality; they will impact (and hopefully adequately address) <u>Process</u>, <u>People</u>, and <u>Technology</u>.</p>
