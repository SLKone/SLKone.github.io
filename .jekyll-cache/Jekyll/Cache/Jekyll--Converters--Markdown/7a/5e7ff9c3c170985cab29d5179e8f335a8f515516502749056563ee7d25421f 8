I"Ä<p>The archetype of a consultant is one of a road warrior. Wake up early on a Monday morning to catch a flight only to return late Thursday or Friday after spending countless hours on a client-site. It has been a badge of honor that I liken to a militaristic mindset of â€œonly being happy only when youâ€™re miserableâ€. However, that is not the SLKone model, and that differentiator is what attracted me to this organization in the first place.</p>
