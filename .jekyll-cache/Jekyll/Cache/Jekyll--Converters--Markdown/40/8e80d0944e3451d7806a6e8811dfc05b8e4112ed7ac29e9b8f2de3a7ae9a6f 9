<ul>
  <li>The client had no visibility to their Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Customer install base; a vital metric to understand the health of a SAAS business</li>
  <li>Finance leadership had pressed internal resources over the course of 9 months to provide insights into this, and other metrics, to no avail</li>
  <li>Due to a combination of resource and perceived data constraints, there had been no successful attempts to identify these metrics</li>
  <li>SLKone was engaged to fill this gap in understanding, and derive an ARR waterfall calculation (including install base), as well as several other key SAAS metrics</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bespoke-solutions">Bespoke Solutions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>SLKone researched the available client data and interviewed several internal teams which resulted in successfully calculating an ARR install base and, subsequently, ARR and Customer base waterfall</li>
  <li>In addition, SLKone was able to calculate other relevant metrics including: CAC, ACL, CLTV, and more</li>
  <li>To convey these metrics readily-accessible workbooks were created to allow for quick and accurate updates</li>
  <li>Analysis was performed for the proceeding six quarters to supplement the metrics with historical performance trending</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="leading-with-results">Leading With Results</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KPIs</strong> which had not existed previously and thought unobtainable <strong>were identified, calculated, and presented over the course of several weeks</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sustainable and easily updatable workbooks</strong> were delivered to <strong>provide insights</strong> into this month, or over the prior 6 quarters trending</li>
  <li><strong>Valuable insight</strong> was provided to the client as <strong>fundamental</strong> revenue and customer <strong>metrics were quantified</strong>, which <strong>prior to their engagement with SLKone had not existed</strong></li>
