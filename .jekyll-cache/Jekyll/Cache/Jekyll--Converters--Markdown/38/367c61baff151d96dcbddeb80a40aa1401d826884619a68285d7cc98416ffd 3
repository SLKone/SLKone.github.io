I"æ<p>Business leaders are facing unrelenting pressure from investors, employees, and other stakeholders to make drastic changes to adapt and survive in this new COVID-19 (and future, post-COVID-19) economy.

The first question that should be asked in the wake of all this disruption is: does my business need a realignment or a full-on restart?</p>
