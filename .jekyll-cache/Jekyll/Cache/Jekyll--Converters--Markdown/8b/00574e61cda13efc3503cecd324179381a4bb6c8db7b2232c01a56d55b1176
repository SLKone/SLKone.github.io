I"N<p>Dusting off my personal library over the weekend, I had a revelation: there were more business strategy books on my shelves than any other subject. Not surprising since, statistically-speaking, there are more books authored on the why, what, and how of business strategy than any other topic. Why so much supply? Likely because there is a voracious demand for more as the business world continues to search for a silver bullet strategy for success. Is it just a mirage? Have all these insightful writings by leaders and gurus fallen short of solving the riddle of business strategy?</p>
