<ul>
  <li>The client had no visibility to their Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) and Customer install base; a vital metric to understand the health of a SAAS business</li>
  <li>Finance leadership had pressed internal resources over the course of 9 months to provide insights into this, and other metrics, to no avail</li>
  <li>Due to a combination of resource and perceived data constraints, there had been no successful attempts to identify these metrics</li>
  <li>SLKone was engaged to fill this gap in understanding, and derive an ARR waterfall calculation (including install base), as well as several other key SAAS metrics</li>
</ul>
