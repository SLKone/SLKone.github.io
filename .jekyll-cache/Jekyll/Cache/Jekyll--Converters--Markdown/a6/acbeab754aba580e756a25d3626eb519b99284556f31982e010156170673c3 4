I"<p>Malcolm Gladwell’s <i>Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know about the People We Don’t Know</i> was the inaugural selection for SLKone’s Breakroom Book Club and marked the beginning of a new adventure for our internal company culture. The goal for our book club initiative is to expand our own perspectives while creating stronger connections with our teammates – especially now that work is so much more remote – and I think it’s safe to say that this read evoked mixed reviews from our voluntary gathering.</p>
