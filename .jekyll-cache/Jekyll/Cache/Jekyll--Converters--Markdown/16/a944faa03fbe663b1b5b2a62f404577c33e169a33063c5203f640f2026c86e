I"ø<p>A robust and operationalized Project Management Office (PMO) can be felt throughout an organization. Project management is a necessity and is so ubiquitous that many organizations devote departments and specific project managers to lead critical initiatives. Large-scale projects or changes in an organization often require the creation of a formal PMO to ensure proper oversight. Even a formal PMO, however, does not guarantee the success of an organization or the projects under its management.</p>
