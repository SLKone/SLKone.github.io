I"Ω<p>This month, we decided to mix it up. Instead of reading a book on leadership, we decided to read a book about the books that leaders read. In The Leader‚Äôs Bookshelf, James Stavridis, a retired four-star admiral of the US Navy, synthesizes the results of a survey of over 200 active and retired four-star generals and admirals in the US Armed Forces. The survey sought to identify the reading habits, favorite books, and list of titles that most impacted the participants‚Äô leadership skills and styles.</p>

<p>From the list of 50, we narrowed down to our top choices in the categories of most likely to read, most relevant to business, and most surprising:</p>

<p>‚Ä¢	<b>Most Likely to Read:</b> <i>Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam</i> by H. R. McMaster
Vietnam is a controversial war that cost countless American lives. H. R. McMaster takes an in-depth look at why America became involved in Vietnam, ultimately concluding that, ‚ÄúThe war in Vietnam was not lost in the field, nor was it lost on the front pages of the New York Times or the college campuses. It was lost in Washington D.C.‚Äù<br /></p>

<p>‚Ä¢	<b>Most Relevant to Business:</b> <i>Hope Is Not a Method: What Business Leaders Can Learn from America‚Äôs Army</i> by Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan and Col. Michael Harper
This book is composed of a series of case studies exploring the task of reorganizing the American military following the Cold War, a daunting task to say the least. The key  takeaway can be conveyed through a single quote: ‚ÄúThe challenge for the leader is not to ‚Äòget it exactly right,‚Äô because there is no ‚Äòit.‚Äô The challenge is to become ‚Äògood enough‚Äô: good enough to seize and exploit developing opportunities, good enough to deploy our forces more rapidly than competitors, good enough to get it ‚Äòabout right‚Äô in execution.‚Äù<br /></p>

<p>‚Ä¢	<b>Most Surprising:</b> <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> by Harper Lee
We were initially surprised to find a work of fiction about a family living in the segregated South on a top-50 book list for leaders. However, Stavridis‚Äô explanation of why this text is favored is eye-opening and inspiring. For leaders, the book is a case study on morality and why doing the ‚Äúhard right thing‚Äù is always better than the ‚Äúeasy wrong thing.‚Äù<br /></p>

<p>Not surprisingly, most of this list is comprised of non-fiction works about war-time generals and presidents which left most of us disappointed as we‚Äôd hoped to find more unanticipated titles. That said, we did pick up a few lessons regarding why we should make reading a priority in our lives and how we can do so:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We all live life from only one perspective. Reading allows us entry into other‚Äôs lives and perspectives, which can ultimately change and refine our own way of viewing the world.<br /></li>
  <li>We don‚Äôt have to read for an hour or longer; it‚Äôs okay to read in time slots as short as five or ten minutes as long as the time is valuable. Fit it in where you can and remember, there is no right or wrong way to read.<br /></li>
  <li>Technology is your friend. If you travel frequently, eReaders or smartphone apps may be strong options. While this won‚Äôt give you the feel of turning pages, sometimes convenience outweighs ritual and provides immense benefits.<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>If nothing else, <i>The Leader‚Äôs Bookshelf</i> reminded us it‚Äôs important to stay curious and never stop learning.</p>
