<ul>
  <li>The client relied on a poorly implemented FP&amp;A tool to handle reporting, review, and analytical needs</li>
  <li>The implementation of the current system required multiple “work arounds” and manual processes to create recurring reports</li>
  <li>The client knew that the current system would have to be replaced or reimplemented after a large acquisition made material changes to their accounting coding system</li>
  <li>SLKone was currently retained as a financial advisor. The client approached SLKone to facilitate the vendor/system selection for the FP&amp;A function going forward</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bespoke-solutions">Bespoke Solutions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>SLKone generated a business requirements document to specify both the tool capability requirements  and the reporting needs</li>
  <li>SLKone performed research, met with FP&amp;A tool vendors, and evaluated two product offerings</li>
  <li>SLKone built an FP&amp;A Tool Evaluation one-pager to assist the leadership team in determining the best FP&amp;A tool</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="leading-with-results">Leading With Results</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Evaluated, selected, and implemented</strong> a new FP&amp;A tool.  The new tool has led to the automation of recurring processes and the streamlining of reporting</li>
  <li><strong>Board report generation reduced to less than a day.</strong>  Board reports are now one-click away rather than taking multiple days of manual work</li>
  <li><strong>Improved transparency of transactions.</strong> Successful implementation empowered drill-down capability to research trends in one system and reduced complexity of multiple systems</li>
  <li><strong>Error reduction.</strong> By automating report generation and managing versions, the new tool eliminated errors related to manual touchpoints</li>
</ul>
