	<p class="large"><strong>How We Do It Better</strong><br />SLKone partners with clients to bridge data with decision making to generate enterprise value. What makes SLKone different is our how we approach the intersection of business generalist and data scientist. Historically, that has been accomplished through the ‚Äúdata translator‚Äù model where management consultants work with data science teams to derive insights. We challenge that model and believe there have been enough advancements in open-source research, education, and resources to apply data science principles and models to our projects. In other words, we‚Äôre consultants who can code and see that as the long-term model for success.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Goals are not executed privately at SLKone.</strong> After setting individual goals, team members share their goals with each other and commit to helping one another deliver those goals; everyone succeeds together.</li>
		<li><strong>There are multiple tracks to success.</strong> We recognize that our talent pool is comprised of innovators and builders that help sales leaders succeed, and it is reflected in our performance.</li>
		<li><strong>We value fairness and use one formula for all performance rewards.</strong> Founders, partners, managers, and consultants all earn within the same operating model.</li>
		<li><strong>Happy consultants deliver exceptional results for clients.</strong> We strive to contribute 100% of our team‚Äôs healthcare benefits, celebrate the joy of parental responsibilities through generous paid leave, and much more through programs that we encourage our team to define.</li>
		<li><strong>We give back to the community.</strong> Whether building houses or supporting education for the underprivileged, SLKone supports our team‚Äôs dedication to giving back as a core pillar to our company‚Äôs mission.</li>
