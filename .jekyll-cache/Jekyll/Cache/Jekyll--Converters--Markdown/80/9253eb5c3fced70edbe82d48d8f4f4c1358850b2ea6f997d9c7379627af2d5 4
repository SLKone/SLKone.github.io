I"Ë<p>The platform â€˜buy, build, and growâ€™ is the core strategy that underpins the investment thesis for small to mid-size private equity funds (PEs). Multiple expansion opportunities get presented in the form of Tuck-In(s), Bolt-on(s) and Add-on(s). Each transaction is different, however, and lean portfolio company management teams routinely stumble, resulting in periods of wayward platform stability and anxiety at the sponsor level. In a hypercompetitive environment of increased multiples, there is no room for error with the time and quality of platform integrations. Portfolio company leadership and operating partners need a playbook that is prescriptive, yet adaptive, and delivers desired outcomes.</p>
