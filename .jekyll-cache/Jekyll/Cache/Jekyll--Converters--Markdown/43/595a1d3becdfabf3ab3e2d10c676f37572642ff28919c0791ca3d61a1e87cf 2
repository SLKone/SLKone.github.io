		<h6>What is Deliberate Thinking?</h6>
		<p>Deliberate Thinking is a collection of neuroscience-based techniques, designed specifically for business leaders, that train the brain to think productively. It uses neurogenesis â€“ the science behind learning new skills and habits â€“ to create cognitive pathways that promote and sustain high performance. This methodology fosters the knowledge and skills to solve unclear situations in your business and your life. </p>

		<p>Due to the complexity and uncertainty of todayâ€™s business climate, hiring brilliant people does not, on its own, guarantee success. Organizations must also learn to leverage the collective brilliance of their people to creatively solve challenges. SLKoneâ€™s Deliberate Thinking workshop provides a cognitive solution that builds conscious competence and helps avoid the common pitfalls of automatic thinking that can get in the way of effective problem-solving.</p>
