<ul>
  <li>A multi-billion dollar aerospace and defense manufacturer suffered from decreasing margins and quality issues on a long-term manufacturing program</li>
  <li>The manufacturing processes were performed on a shared manufacturing cell and were not prioritized due to the production volume</li>
  <li>The program was extended for low-rate production and spare production for an additional ten years which could result in significant profitability impacts</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bespoke-solutions">Bespoke Solutions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Members of SLKone led a one-week kaizen improvement project to identify high-impact improvements to the program</li>
  <li>Identified quick-wins and long-term improvements for the program, including benefits for other programs produced on the cell equipment</li>
  <li>A prioritization and program management approach was developed and leveraged to track progress</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="leading-with-results">Leading With Results</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Improvements implemented in half of target timelines:</strong> Improvements identified were implemented within three months of the event, half the time of initial goal timeline</li>
  <li><strong>Cost reductions of over $5M for the life of the program:</strong> Production and flow improvements for the production cell resulted in over $5M in cost reductions for the duration of the program</li>
  <li><strong>On-time-delivery improved by 20%:</strong> Scheduling and production process modifications contributed to an on-time-delivery improvement of over 20%</li>
</ul>
