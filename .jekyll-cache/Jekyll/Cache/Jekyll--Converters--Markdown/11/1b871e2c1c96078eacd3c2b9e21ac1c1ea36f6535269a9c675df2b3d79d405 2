I"¤<p>Over the last few years, Private Equity (PE) firms have seen exceptional returns on their portfolios and, coupled with an influx of investor capital into these firms, we have seen mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) transactions grow significantly. According to data gathered from S&amp;P Capital IQ, the last three months (Julâ€™21 â€“ Sepâ€™21) aggregated deal amount for US private equity investments totaled $243B in 2,841 transactions for an average deal size of $85M. Compare this to the same period in 2019 where the aggregated deal amount was $78.5B with an average deal size $45M, this represents a ~3X growth in M&amp;A transaction dollar volume and a 90% growth in the average deal size. There are undoubtedly several factors for this increase in transaction volume, but one major driving force of attraction to the PE space is the excess returns when compared to public equity indexes such as the S&amp;P or DJIA.</p>
