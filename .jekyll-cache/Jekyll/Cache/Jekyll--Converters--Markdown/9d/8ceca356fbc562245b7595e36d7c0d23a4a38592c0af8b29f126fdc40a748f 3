  <li>SLKone performed a deep-dive analysis of the organization including customer profitability, production run performance, defect analysis, and product flow</li>
  <li>Customer profitability and production order analysis yielded a long tail of low-profitability, high complexity customers requiring rationalization</li>
  <li>Product production flow and defect analysis illustrated poor plant layout and equipment issues created large profitability and production inefficiencies</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="leading-with-results">Leading With Results</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved product on-time-delivery:</strong>  The reconfiguration of the plant layout allow for decreased production times and improved quality resulting in improved on-time-delivery metrics</li>
  <li><strong>Profitability Improved by over 20%:</strong>  Identifying low-profit, high complexity customers and orders, and placing fees for setup and minimal run quantities resulted in over 20% of profitability improvement for these customers</li>
  <li><strong>Additional product capacity:</strong> The improvement in product flow and complexity reduction freed up additional capacity to take on part transfers from other facilities with capacity constraints leading to overall company profitability improvements</li>
