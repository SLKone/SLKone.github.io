I"ƒ<p>Mission + Passion + Vocation + Profession = Our Purpose</p>

<p>In May of 2018, three founding partners met in front of a blank whiteboard. In one column, they recorded everything they disliked about working with consultants while they were in industry; in the other, everything they disliked about the consulting industry while they were consultants. Their blend of deep industry experience and commitment to this fresh perspective resulted in a select group of individuals seeking to redefine the purpose of a consultant by bringing together their mission, passion, vocation, and profession. We continue to challenge the norms and provide our clients with unique solutions by constantly asking ourselves: ‚ÄúHow may we do this better?‚Äù</p>

<p>SLKone is a Bespoke Management Consulting Firm bridging Strategy, Leadership, and Knowledge to build lasting solutions. We consistently achieve client satisfaction and form long term working relationships while empowering our consultants with stimulating learning opportunities, freedom to innovate, client exposure, and unparalleled work life harmony.</p>

<p>We accomplish this through mindfulness of our five pillars in every action we undertake; we want to build a <strong>Firm for the Future</strong> that will outlast ourselves; we select work that is <strong>Professionally Rewarding</strong> so we can enjoy the process and leave a lasting impact; we seek to be <strong>Financially Successful</strong> by doing work that enriches us and our clients; we live <strong>Work Life Harmony</strong> because happiness at work leads to happiness at home and vice-versa; and we emphasize <strong>Giving back to the Community</strong> by leaving a place better than we found it.</p>
