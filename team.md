title: "SLKone's Team Philosophy"
subtitle: "Mission + Passion + Vocation + Profession = Our Purpose"
intro: "At SLKone, we have redefined the purpose of a consultant by bringing all those things we used to think about into actions."
excerpt: "You hate billable hours as a measure of your success. It’s well-understood that as a metric, it’s completely counterintuitive to the best interest of our clients. It’s also one of the things SLKone does differently. 

We also believe that only a happy team can deliver exceptional results for our clients, which is why we foster an environment where your productivity, intellectual development, and personal growth is in harmony with the wellbeing of you and your family."

<h4>Whereas a typical consultant is measured by the hours billed, a SLKone team member is driven by the desire to deliver successful outcomes for our clients. That’s our ‘purpose’ or our Ikigai.  </h4>
<ul>
	<li>We combine ‘Our clients’ needs’ with ‘What we love to do’ and make it our Mission</li>
	<li>Because ‘What we love to do’ is rooted in ‘What we are good at’ it brings out our Passion in what we do</li>
	<li>Our only Vocation is ‘What our clients need’ and ‘Where they realize the most value’</li>
	<li>We direct ‘What we are good at’ with ‘Where clients would realize the most value to reward us’ and make it our Profession by delivering bespoke solutions to our Corporate and Private Clients.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How we do it</h4>
<p><strong>Goals are not executed privately at SLKone.</strong> After setting individual goals, team members share their goals with the team. The team then helps the person deliver the goals. The outcome is that everyone succeeds because of others.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple tracks to succeed.</strong> We recognize that our talent pool comprises of innovators and builders that help sales leaders succeed and it reflects in our performance system.</p>
<p><strong>One formula for performance rewards.</strong> The founders, partners, managers, and consultants earn their performance rewards with the same operating model.</p>
<p><strong>Happy consultants deliver exceptional results for clients.</strong> We strive to contribute to 100% of team’s healthcare benefits; Celebrate the joy, and parental responsibilities through generous paid leave; and many other programs that we encourage our team to define.</p>
<p><strong>By giving back to the community</strong> Whether building houses or supporting education for underprivileged, SLKone supports our team’s dedication to giving back as core to our company mission.</p>
