		<h6>What is Deliberate Thinking?</h6>
		<p>Deliberate Thinking is a collection of neuroscience-based techniques, designed specifically for business leaders, that train the brain to think productively. It uses neurogenesis – the science behind learning new skills and habits – to create cognitive pathways that promote and sustain high performance. This methodology fosters the knowledge and skills to solve unclear situations in your business and your life. </p>

		<h6>Businesses need better solutions</h6>
		<p>Due to the complexity and uncertainty of today’s business climate, hiring brilliant people does not, on its own, guarantee success. Organizations must also learn to leverage the collective brilliance of their people to creatively solve challenges. SLKone’s Deliberate Thinking workshop provides a cognitive solution that builds conscious competence and helps avoid the common pitfalls of automatic thinking that can get in the way of effective problem-solving.</p>
