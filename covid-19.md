***An Open Letter to Our Clients, Partners, and Network:***

The world and economy is in uncharted territories â€“ COVID-19 has officially been declared a pandemic, markets are as much or more volatile than they have ever been, and the oil markets are at their lowest points in over five years. All of these factors have created an immediate cloud of uncertainty and what appears on the surface to be cause for panic. However, in troubling times, opportunity also exists.

SLKone remains committed to the success of our clients, partners, and networks. Through our implementation-focused approach, team of experts (both internally and through our partner network), and roll-up-the-sleeves mentality, we are able to continue to assist our clients in their missions.

This uncertain environment creates opportunities to assess business continuity readiness, strategic approaches, market opportunities, and cost structures to ensure success for years to come. Through a diligent approach, we help our clients navigate through the fog of uncertainty to achieve their goals and mitigate the potential downside existing in the market. 

We are here to serve you and your business needs. Please reach out to us at hello@slkone.com.
 
Best,
The SLKone Team
