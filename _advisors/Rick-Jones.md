He holds an MBA and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business, serves as an outside director of a PE-backed logistics services company, and is an advisory board member of three other technology-enabled companies in the artificial intelligence, transportation, and human resources industries. 

Rick has 35 years of experience in business services, transportation, and logistics services. He also spent 11 years leading middle-market, PE-backed business services companies. 

Prior to founding Real Logistics, Jones was the CEO of Van Pool, a middle-market PE-backed company, based in Massachusetts, focused on special needs student services, where he led the company through a successful exit. Before that, he was the CEO of LSO, a PE-backed regional transportation company based in Texas, where he led the company through two acquisitions and two PE exits.

He later joined Sanmina-SCI, an Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) provider as Vice President of Global Logistics Solutions before making the move to lead PE-backed companies in 2007.
