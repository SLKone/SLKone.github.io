	<p class="large">The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the speed with which the contagion has spread, 
has wreacked havoc on our lives and the economy. Across all industries, businesses did not have significant 
warning and were therefore ill-equipped to deal with the consequences.</p>
	<p class="large">Small-to-medium sized companies with lean resources have been impacted the most. Many are unclear on how to
adapt and restart business as we return to normal or transition to a “new normal”. There are no silver bullets or magic-wand answers, but we can work through these uncharted waters together -- in our Business Restart Incubator.</p>

	<h4>Do I need Business Restart Support?</h4>
	<p class="large">In all likelihood, YES. 
Here is a preliminary set of questions to think through regarding why an organization may need restart support: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Has your primary business activity been adjusted or changed?</li>
		<li>Will your business go back to the old ways or will the changes persist?</li>
		<li>Have you had any significant changes in terms of staffing, financial situation, or strategic direction?</li>
		<li>Have you stopped or paused any expansion or M&A activity?</li>
		<li>Do you consider there to be opportunity for expansion or M&A activity?</li>
		<li>Are investors, equity sponsors, or other stakeholders applying pressure or asking difficult questions
	  to which you may not currently have the answer?</li>
	</ul>

sequenced to specifically restart businesses, navigate through uncertainty, and emerge from the impacts of the global pandemic. </p>
